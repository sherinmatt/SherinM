            Background Information: For this Rutgers Capstone work, the main goal was to employ agile methodologies and design thinking to research and design a healthcare technology tool with Capstone team members- under Johnson & Johnson staff's supervision.
            Conducted market research analysis, experimentation and created a Business Model Canvas for a healthcare solution that would allow psychiatrists to make faster and accurate diagnoses by cross-referencing a patient's acute symptoms with EMR (Electronic Medical Records).
            Utilized Trello Board, Kanban methodology.
        </p>
        <p> Capstone Objective: Creating a healthcare solution,“Rosewell”, that will aid psychiatrist in making efficient and accurate diagnosis so as to reduce healthcare costs and time</p>

        <p> Tasks Undertaken - Market Research -> Our Solution (RoseWell Prototype) -> Data Strategy -> Financial Plan
